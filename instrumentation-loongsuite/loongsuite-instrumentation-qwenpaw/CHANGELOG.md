## Unreleased

## Version 0.9.0 (2026-09-07)

### Fixed

- Limit Dream tests to the QwenPaw 2 runtime and verify that QwenPaw 1 and
  legacy CoPaw retain Entry instrumentation without enabling Dream hooks.

- Propagate the owning agent name during QwenPaw 2 ReMe Dream calls so
  instrumented downstream LLM spans carry `gen_ai.agent.name`. Restore the
  caller context on completion, failure, or cancellation; no agent ID is added.

- Treat `asyncio.CancelledError` as control flow at Entry finalization while
  preserving the original exception. Record `qwenpaw.cancelled` and a bounded
  `qwenpaw.cancellation.reason` from explicit cancellation codes; missing or
  unrecognized reasons are `unknown`, not inferred from partial responses.

## Version 0.8.0 (2026-07-31)

### Added

- Added QwenPaw 2 Entry telemetry around each `Runtime.run` request while
  preserving the QwenPaw 1 and legacy CoPaw entry points.
- Added task-safe stream context handoff so QwenPaw heartbeat tasks inherit the
  Entry span without keeping an attached context token across yields.
- Records QwenPaw 2 Entry TTFT only after user-visible output and preserves
  business stream cleanup when Entry telemetry setup fails.

### Fixed

- Restore the Entry context while closing downstream streams and preserve
  downstream `aclose()` errors instead of finalizing the Entry as successful.

## Version 0.7.0 (2026-07-03)

There are no changelog entries for this release.

## Version 0.6.0 (2026-06-03)

There are no changelog entries for this release.

## Version 0.5.0 (2026-05-11)

### Added

- Renamed the primary instrumentation package to QwenPaw and kept runtime
  compatibility for `copaw <= 1.0.2`.
- Added latest and legacy runtime test dependency sets.

### Changed

- Kept QwenPaw as the single auto-instrumentation entry point while retaining
  legacy import/runtime compatibility.

## Version 0.4.0 (2026-04-03)

### Added

- **CoPaw instrumentation initialization**: ``CoPawInstrumentor`` registers
  automatic instrumentation for CoPaw when ``instrument()`` is called (included
  in LoongSuite distro automatic injection).
  ([#162](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/162))

### Changed

- Instrumentor depends on ``opentelemetry-util-genai`` and passes
  ``tracer_provider``, ``meter_provider``, and ``logger_provider`` from
  ``instrument()`` into the shared GenAI telemetry handler.
  ([#162](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/162))
