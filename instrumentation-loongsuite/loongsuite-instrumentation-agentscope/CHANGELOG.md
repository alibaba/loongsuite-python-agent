## Unreleased

## Version 0.9.0 (2026-09-07)

### Fixed

- Treat AgentScope v2 cancellation as control flow, with an explicit
  `agentscope.cancelled` attribute, including interrupted reply events when
  the framework consumes the exception. Preserve business exceptions and do
  not invent final LLM usage or finish reasons for interrupted streams.
- Capture cache-read and cache-creation input tokens in AgentScope v1 and v2,
  including final streaming and v2 agent usage, without adding cached tokens
  to input totals.
- Split AgentScope v2 cumulative assistant history at tool results, preserving
  chronological assistant/tool roles without changing the application context.
- Respect the model formatter's thinking-input capability in LLM history and
  limit agent output to final visible text, leaving reasoning and tools on child spans.
- Prefer Entry session/user baggage over AgentScope's internal session identity
  and propagate the conversation to ReAct, LLM, and tool spans.
- Fail open when v2 input conversion fails and finalize agent spans even when
  output conversion raises.

## Version 0.8.0 (2026-07-31)

### Fixed

- Derive AgentScope v2 ReAct rounds from the agent iteration state instead of
  a `ContextVar` token that could fail when QwenPaw advances a reply stream
  from different asyncio tasks.
- Restore Agent, ReAct, and tool span contexts for each stream advance so
  cross-task QwenPaw handoffs preserve parentage, and treat `GeneratorExit` as
  a successful stream close instead of a tool failure.
- Start AgentScope v2 streaming LLM spans before invoking the underlying model,
  restore their context for each stream operation, and treat cross-task
  `GeneratorExit` as a successful close while preserving TTFT.
- Model AgentScope v2 ReAct iterations from `on_reasoning` so each `react step`
  span parents both its LLM call and tool executions, including concurrent
  tools and QwenPaw cross-task stream handoffs.
- Capture AgentScope v2 string message content as text parts so LLM input and
  output message attributes are populated when content capture is enabled.

### Added

- Capture `gen_ai.skill.name`, `gen_ai.skill.id`, and available skill metadata
  on AgentScope v2 built-in `Skill` viewer tool spans.

## Version 0.7.0 (2026-07-03)

### Added

- Add version-aware AgentScope v2 middleware instrumentation while preserving
  AgentScope v1 compatibility.

## Version 0.6.0 (2026-06-03)

There are no changelog entries for this release.

## Version 0.5.0 (2026-05-11)

### Added

- Detect skill-load tool executions by matching reads of registered skills'
  top-level `SKILL.md`, and enrich the corresponding `execute_tool` span with
  `gen_ai.skill.name`, `gen_ai.skill.id`, `gen_ai.skill.description`, and
  `gen_ai.skill.version`.

### Fixed

- Pin `wrapt` to `< 2.0.0` for AgentScope instrumentation compatibility with
  the current wrapper API usage.
- Fix cross-agent state leak: add `owner` field to `_ReactStepState` and
  validate `state.owner is agent_self` in all ReAct hooks, so a child agent
  called within a parent agent's execution context can no longer read or
  mutate the parent's step state via the shared `_REACT_STATE` ContextVar.

## Version 0.4.0 (2026-04-03)

There are no changelog entries for this release.

## Version 0.3.0 (2026-03-27)

### Changed

- Adapt imports to `opentelemetry-util-genai` module layout change
  ([#158](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/158))

### Fixed

- Avoid duplicate LLM / Agent spans when multiple `ChatModelBase` or
  `AgentBase` subclasses stack (e.g. proxy layers that each implement `__call__`
  and forward inward), by tracking per-task `__call__` depth with
  `contextvars` and only instrumenting the outermost frame
  ([#153](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/153))
- Avoid duplicate `react step` spans when ReAct hook wrappers nest (e.g.
  subclasses or mixins that override `_reasoning` / `_acting` and call
  `super()`), by only opening steps and updating tool-act counts on the
  outermost wrapper
  ([#153](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/153))

### Changed

- Update README integration flow to align with the root recommended LoongSuite pattern using Option C (`pip install loongsuite-instrumentation-agentscope`) and `loongsuite-instrument`.
  ([#159](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/159))

### Added

- Add ReAct step span instrumentation for ReAct agents
  ([#140](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/140))
  - Each ReAct iteration is wrapped in a `react step` span with `gen_ai.react.round` and `gen_ai.react.finish_reason` attributes
  - Uses AgentScope's instance-level hook system for robust, non-invasive instrumentation

## Version 0.2.0 (2026-03-12)

There are no changelog entries for this release.

## Version 0.1.0 (2026-02-28)

### Fixed

- Fix tool call response parsing
  ([#118](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/118))
- Fix LLM message content capture in spans
  ([#91](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/91))
- Fix spell mistake in pyproject.toml
  ([#8](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/8))

### Breaking Changes

- Deprecate the support for AgentScope v0
  ([#82](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/82))

### Changed

- Refactor the instrumentation for AgentScope with `genai-util`
  ([#82](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/82))
  - **Refactored to use opentelemetry-util-genai**: Migrated to `ExtendedTelemetryHandler` and `ExtendedInvocationMetricsRecorder` from `opentelemetry-util-genai` for unified metrics and tracing management
  - **Architecture Simplification**: Removed redundant code and consolidated instrumentation logic
  - **Tool Tracing Enhancement**: Rewritten tool execution tracing to use `ExtendedTelemetryHandler` for full feature support (see HANDLER_INTEGRATION.md)
    - Now properly leverages `_apply_execute_tool_finish_attributes` for standardized attribute handling
    - Automatic metrics recording for tool executions
    - Content capturing mode support (respects experimental mode and content capturing settings)
    - Unified error handling with proper error attributes
  - Removed "V1" prefix from class names (AgentScopeV1ChatModelWrapper → AgentScopeChatModelWrapper, etc.)
  - Updated to use Apache License 2.0 headers across all source files
- Refactor the instrumentation for AgentScope
  ([#14](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/14))

### Added

- Add support for agentscope v1.0.0
  ([#45](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/45))
- Initialize the instrumentation for AgentScope
  ([#2](https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-python/pull/2))
