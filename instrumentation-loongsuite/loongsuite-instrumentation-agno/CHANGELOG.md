## Unreleased

## Version 0.9.0 (2026-09-07)

There are no changelog entries for this release.

## Version 0.8.0 (2026-07-31)

### Changed

- Split Agno 2.x tool-call loops into ReAct step spans with one LLM span per
  provider request, and populate streaming agent token usage from child LLM
  spans when Agno run events do not include metrics.
- Propagate Agno run user and session identity to model and tool spans while
  preferring ENTRY baggage identity over Agno framework-provided values.

### Added

- Capture `gen_ai.skill.*` attributes on Agno skill tool spans such as
  `get_skill_instructions`, `get_skill_reference`, and `get_skill_script`.

## Version 0.7.0 (2026-07-03)

### Removed

- Remove the direct `pydantic` runtime dependency from Agno instrumentation.

## Version 0.6.0 (2026-06-03)

### Removed

- Drop Agno 1.x support and require Agno 2.x public `Agent.run`/`Agent.arun`
  APIs. Users that still depend on Agno 1.x should pin
  `loongsuite-instrumentation-agno < 0.6`.

### Changed

- Align message content capture with `opentelemetry-util-genai` controls such as
  `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=SPAN_ONLY`.
- Migrate Agno instrumentation to Agno 2.x public `Agent.run`/`Agent.arun`
  APIs and `opentelemetry-util-genai` `ExtendedTelemetryHandler`.
- Emit standardized AGENT, LLM, and TOOL GenAI spans for agent runs, model
  calls, streaming calls, async streaming calls, and function executions.

### Added

- Add a DashScope smoke example that exercises non-streaming, streaming, and
  concurrent Agno calls.
- Add local test requirements for the Agno LoongSuite tox environment.
